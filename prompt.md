# BBY Coding Challenge
## Prompts

1. Pick a language and write a function(s) to find the first, 7 digit, prime, palindromic number in the digits of Pi

Code does NOT need to calculate the digits of pi, feel free to copy paste a string into your repo, but must be able to programmatically find the answer

2. Build a tool (command line or visual) to keep score of 2-4 people bowling. The program should be able to keep track of all players, frame by frame, for at least a complete game of 10 frames. The scoring should follow “Traditional Scoring” (wiki: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten-pin_bowling). Imagine yourself as the user of this program.
